    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "*   We look into the Top 50 Spotify Tracks to get an understanding for what makes a song popular at least using the 2020 data.\n",
    "*   The artists that had the most amount tracks in the top 50 were: `Dua Lipa`, `Travis Scott`, `Billie Eilish` with `Dua Lipa` representing more pop-based songs on her album `Future Nostalgia`, `Travis Scott` producing highly-danceable `Trap` songs with hit albums `ASTROWORLD`, `Birds In The Trap Sing McKnight` & the single `HIGHEST IN THE ROOM` & `Billie Eilish` showing up with 2 singles & 1 album track in more unique, less-known genres like Chamber-Pop & Electro-Pop.\n",
    "*   There are 16 unique genres define, with 12 main genres & 10 secondary genres in the top 50 track list. The most popular genres are `Pop`, `Hip-Hop` & `Rap`, which all have more than 12 songs in the top 50, far exceeding the other genres in terms of number of songs in the top 50. However,  `R&B` & `Soul` seem to be genres that have very high average positions in the top 50 compared to other genres. This may be an indication of a possible unmet demand for genres within the `R&B` style of music that could be (and maybe should be) pushed to more people than other types of music?\n",
    "*   In the top 50 track list, 15 songs are singles & the rest 35 are from albums. Although there are no significant differences between average positions of the two types of song releases. \n",
    "*   The most popular albums in the top 50 Spotify track list of 2020 are: `Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia`, `Justin Bieber's Changes`, `Post Malone's Hollywood's Bleeding` & `Harry Style's Fine Line`. Most of these albums are `Pop` based and not surprising to end up in the top albums of 2020.\n",
    "*   Artists might find success not only on their own solo songs, but on featuring in others' songs too - in 2020,  artists found that type of success: Ariana Grande (on `Rain On Me` with `Lady Gaga`) & `Juice WRLD` (on `Godzilla` with `Eminem`). However, there are artists that are better off doing solo projects - e.g. Justin Bieber (on `Stuck with U` from `Ariana Grande`) & Drake (on `Life Is Good` from `Future`). There are also artists that only appeared as features on the top 50 tracks, e.g. `Quavo` on `Intentions` with `Justin Bieber`. And `Roddy Ricch` was successful as both a feature and a solo artist. \n",
    "*   We find there are 3 strong correlations of note: \n",
    "    *   `loudness` - `energy` (*0.79164*)\n",
    "    *   `energy` - `acousticness` (*-0.682479*)\n",
    "    *   `instrumentalness` - `loudness` (*-0.553735*)\n",
    "*   We tap into per genre analysis for the entire list of features in the dataset [here](#per_genre_observations).\n",
    "*   We find that the Top 50 Spotify track list, has mostly songs that have a high `danceability`, `valence` & `energy` scores and are around 3-4 minutes long."

Additionally, the most danceable track is Cardi B's \"WAP\", which is a Hip-Hop/Trap track - both of these genres are well known for being dance-oriented. We will check later on if that hypothesis rings true. Again, the tracks are situated more in the top of the list, which may indicate that danceable tracks dominate which tracks get to be the most popular out of the popular tracks in general. The fact that social media started using tracks for short form content can also be a factor in this case (think - TikToks & IG reals).*\n",

    "#### Observations\n",
    "*Some values to point out:*\n",
    "*   There is not that much variance in the `energy` variable - only `chamber-pop` seems to have significantly lower energy compared to other genres, that average around 0.5 - 0.7.\n",
    "*   `Danceability` has two standouts - `Trap` (with a `danceability` of 0.935) & `Chamber-pop` (with a `danceability` of 0.351) on both sides of the spectrum. Although, each of these genres have only 1 song in the top 50 list. So maybe should not be read into as much. It does seem that majority of genres peter out at ~0.7, which could be thought of as an indicator that songs, at least according to this list, have to be at least 0.6 in the `danceability` department.\n",
    "*   There is a lot of variability in `loudness` between all genres. However, the genres that have the highest amount of tracks in the top 50 (`Rap`, `Pop` & `Hip-Hop`) all average out at around 6.2-6.9. Although, we should take into account that stylistcally, these three genres have a lot in common.\n",
    "*   The `acousticness` metric is dominated by the `Indie`, `Alternative`, `Chamber-Pop` & `Dream-Pop` genres, which stylistically have more acoustic instruments performances (e.g. Piano, Classical Guitar)\n",
    "*   Almost all genres have `instrumentalness` as 0, which indicates that all popular songs have to have vocals. \n",
    "*   The `liveness` value is quite low for all genres. This reflects reality since most songs that go wildly popular are studio-recorded albums or singles rather than in the presence of a live audience. This is done to provide the best possible audio quality for the song/artist to shine.\n",
    "*   Interestingly, the `valence` value for all genres is quite high - 14 out of 21 unique genres have positive average `valences`. This indicates that for a song to be very popular, it ***mostly*** has to be positive, rather than negative, which means a value of more than 0.50. At least according to the 2020 Spotify Top 50 Track list. \n",
    "*   As for the `tempo` value, most genres, atleast a tempo of 100 beats/minute, barring some exceptions, e.g.`Dreampop`, `Pop Rap`, `Reggaeton`, which all have 1 song in each genre. Based on the fact that we have 37 songs that have a tempo of at least 100 out of the 50 and 11 out of the top 15 songs in the 100 beats/minute club, we could interpolate, that for a song to be popular it ***mostly*** has to be above 100 beats/minute. But not necessarily that faster songs perform better, in general (since there are exceptions to this as shown below). \n",

    "*Whilst these filters are not the best at identifying the most popular songs (we only got 14 out of the 50 songs in the track list & 6 out of the top 15 tracks), I think it reflects two things: the generalizaton of these metrics and their inability to portray what certain features the track has (e.g. what if it's a new song - released in November 2020? - it might not have had enough time to reach the amount of streams needed to crack the top 50, but it would be wildly popular towards the end of the year (a momentum metric)) & the somewhat difficult nature of the study object. By the latter, I mean that we are studying art with numbers, which is not the easiest to do and since art is more about emotion, feel and relatability, it is difficult to quantify what songs may be hits and which are duds.*"
